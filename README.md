###PocoSqlGenerator###

A simple windows forms application which creates POCO/model classes, Base repository and related repository classes for the database tables in order to use Dapper ORM framework (which I mostly use in my desktop and web applications) and basic stored procedures scripts (like insert, update, delete etc) for the selected database tables

A simple guide on how to use this tool can be found at my blog :  http://www.techierathore.com/2016/04/simple-poco-n-sql-generator-in-c/

###Contributing###

Altough I have tried to make this tool simple and easy to use but it might be missing feature X, or Y. If you want something that it can't currently provide, I love pull requests. If it's a bigger change, you can also create new tool using this code.
